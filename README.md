# Cloak and Danger

A multi-genre game about a girl who can transform into a rat.

My daughter and I made it during November 2024 and submitted it just in time for Game Off 2024. The theme was "secrets" and we really leaned into that â€” you collect secrets, find secret passages, etc.

## Retro

- There were a lot of things we had to cut due to lack of time, unfortunately
- After the game jam voting is over, we'd like to revisit those
  - transform into a penguin at the end
  - add more sound
- Phaser is a powerful game engine but it was frustrating at times
  - it doesn't follow semver
  - the official docs have broken links
  - many online tutorials etc are using outdated APIs
